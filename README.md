# ShapeVisitor

Visitor Pattern for different Shape
Create an interface or abstract base class 'Shape'.Implement three concrete Shapes: 'Circle', 'Rectangle', 'Triangle'.Apply the visitor pattern to your data model.Write an AreaVisitor that computes the area of the shapes.Write a program that makes arbitrary instances of the data model and applies the AreaVisitor. 

# Assessment
The purpose of this test is for you to show us your idea of the ideal solutions to these problems. Write code you would be proud to submit in the workplace; we will assess it with the same critical eye we apply to our own code.
 
Clear, simple and elegant object-oriented code is important. However, we do not want to see the minimum possible solution; you should consider maintainability and extensibility and demonstrate that you can make appropriate abstractions. A solution using the fewest possible lines of code is unlikely to pass the assessment.

# Guidelines
Generalise from these requirements as you wish and demonstrate that you can write clear, maintainable and extensible code.
 
As a guide, you should expect to spend approximately 3-4 hours for the combined test, but you may take as much time as you wish. Please return your responses to me (tarball of project source files only) by return email by Monday morning Please do not include any compiled files in the archive (e.g. .o, .obj, .a or executables for C++, .class or .jar for Java) If you do, it will be blocked by our email system.           
 
Hints & tips:
At IMC they are strong believers in the S.O.L.I.D. development methodology (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design) and https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) so I recommend giving this a review. 
 
Pointers: They look for clean, well commented code that is easy to understand and work with, so..
Neat / Readable / OrganisedClean / Lean / Performance focusedReplaceableScalableMake sure your Implementations are extensible to other interfaces where applicableStrong OO principals & designInclude Unit Tests & Abstractions where applicable 
 
And most importantly, TEST YOUR SOLUTIONS thoroughly before you submit. Nothing more embarrassing than solutions that error or simply fail to run â€“ you have 48hrs, use it!
